First we have a streamlit app with our code. Then we retrieve inside this program the skills icon build and host by the open source projetcs Skill icon (https://github.com/LelouchFR/skill-icons). Also in order to store the illustration : icon, illustration image. We have a folder name assets that is the source for the streamlit app.  Also when the user fill the formula in the streamlit that send a message via a webhook into a slack channel
